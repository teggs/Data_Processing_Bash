#introduction: This file uses stn_results which is produced by bash file
#	       stngrep as input, and produces a file named routeinfo which
#	       stores all the possible routes.
#	       use command "cat routeinfo" to check the results after 
#	       executing this file. 
#parameter: $1 The time you start. The right form should be 12:00:00.
#           $2 The day you go out. You can only input an integer from 1 to 7,
#              which stands for Monday to Sunday.
